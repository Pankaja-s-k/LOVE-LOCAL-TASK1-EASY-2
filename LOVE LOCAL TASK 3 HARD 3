The Algorithm:
Initialization:

Initialize count to store the total count of digit 1 occurrences.
Initialize factor to 1. This will be used to traverse through each digit place in the number.
Looping through each digit place:

While factor is less than or equal to n:
Calculate the three parts of the number at the current digit place:
before: Digits to the left of the current digit place.
current: The digit at the current position.
after: Digits to the right of the current digit place.
Counting the occurrences:

Check the value of current digit:
If current > 1, it contributes (before + 1) * factor occurrences of digit 1.
If current == 1, it contributes before * factor + after + 1 occurrences.
If current < 1, it contributes before * factor.
Updating the factor:

Multiply factor by 10 to move to the next digit place (from ones to tens, tens to hundreds, and so on).
Return the Count:

Once the loop finishes, return the total count of digit 1 occurrences.
Detailed Explanation:
Looping through each digit place:

For each digit place (ones, tens, hundreds, etc.), the algorithm calculates the occurrences of digit 1 considering the value of the current digit (current), digits to the left (before), and digits to the right (after) of the current digit place.
Counting the occurrences:

The count is calculated differently based on the value of the current digit (current) at that place:
If current > 1, it contributes to the count based on the count of numbers that have 1 at that position.
If current == 1, it involves a bit more calculation as it contributes differently based on numbers to its left (before) and right (after).
If current < 1, it doesn't contribute to the count directly but affects the count of numbers to its left.
Updating the factor:

After processing the current digit place, the factor is updated to move to the next digit place (tens, hundreds, etc.) by multiplying it by 10.
Return the Count:

Once all digit places have been traversed, the algorithm returns the accumulated count of digit 1 occurrences.
The algorithm efficiently computes the count of digit 1 appearances across the range of numbers from 0 to n, adhering to the constraints specified in the problem statement.

The solution I provided earlier is a relatively concise code that efficiently solves the problem. It might be possible to achieve a similar outcome using a different approach or by implementing a longer code that accomplishes the same task. However, a different approach might not necessarily be shorter or easier to understand.

The essence of the solution revolves around understanding the pattern of occurrences of the digit 1 in different digit places and then systematically counting them across the range of numbers up to n.

While it's possible to write longer code that breaks down the solution into more detailed steps or includes additional supporting functions, the core logic for counting the digit 1 occurrences in a systematic manner remains relatively similar to the provided solution.

If you're interested in exploring alternative approaches or longer, more detailed implementations of this problem, I can certainly help with that! Just let me know if you'd like to delve deeper into this or explore a different approach.
