Initialization: Initialize two variables candidate1 and candidate2 to represent the potential majority elements. Also, initialize their respective counts (count1 and count2) to keep track of occurrences.

First Pass - Finding Potential Candidates:

Traverse through the array.
Update candidates and their counts based on certain conditions:
If nums[i] matches candidate1 or candidate2, increment the respective count.
Else if either count1 or count2 is zero, update the corresponding candidate and reset its count to 1.
Else decrement both counts as the current element doesn't match any candidates.
Second Pass - Verifying Candidates:

Reset the counts to zero.
Count occurrences of candidate1 and candidate2 in the array.
If the counts of candidates are greater than n/3, add them to the result.
